Next, we define the training algorithm. In this case, we are using the ADAM algorithm. This is the most
commonly used one. 

We also define categotical cross-entropy as the loss function. This is the same
as the cross-entropy covered in class. However, we sum the probabilities over all categories. 

Finally, we define the performance metric. In this case, we are interested in how many images are being
classified correctly. Thus, we use accuracy.
